#Project Overview:

The project revolves around the exploration of the S&P 500 Companies dataset, which is sourced from Wikipedia. The dataset provides valuable information about the companies listed in the S&P 500 index. The primary objectives of this project are to understand the composition of the S&P 500 index, visualize key insights, and potentially identify patterns in the data.

#Data Source:

The dataset was collected from Wikipedia through web scraping. The Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies) contains a table with the following attributes for each S&P 500 company:

Symbol
Company Name
Industry
Sub-Industry
Headquarters Location
Date Added to the Index
Central Index Key (CIK)
Year Founded
The data was extracted and transformed into a structured format and saved as a CSV file for further analysis through an ETL Pipeline.


#Data Description:

Symbol: Unique symbols for each company in the S&P 500.
Company Name: The names of the S&P 500 companies.
Industry: The primary industry each company operates in.
Sub-Industry: More specific categorization within the industry.
Headquarters Location: The location of each company's headquarters.
Date Added to the Index: The date when each company was added to the S&P 500.
Central Index Key (CIK): A unique identifier for each company.
Year Founded: The year in which each company was established.



#Data License and Potential Issues:

The dataset is sourced from Wikipedia and is subject to the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license. This means it is openly available for use but requires attribution and sharing under the same license.

A potential issue with the dataset is the possibility of inaccuracies or biases due to its collaborative and user-contributed nature on Wikipedia. We should be mindful of the need for data validation and verification.



#Project Outcome:

By the end of this project, we had a comprehensive understanding of the S&P 500 Companies dataset. We provided valuable insights and visualizations that shed light on the composition of the S&P 500, including the dominant industries, and historical trends. This information can be useful for investors, researchers, and anyone interested in the dynamics of the S&P 500 index.
